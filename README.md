# microservice-demo
please run gateway on port 8000 , user service on port 8066 and product service on 8067

It's my first experience in microservice
Unfortunately I couldn't implement all part of the Scenario.
User can submit , login , submit product , check product , check product view count , get list of related products , edit and delete product.
I used api token for auth.
